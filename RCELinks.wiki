 * [http://www.cryptocracking.cjb.net/ [ cRYPTO cRACKING ] Advanced crypto tutorials and tools.

 Welcome to bLaCk-eye's home page. This site is mostly dedicated to cryptography
 and how to crack it in various protection schemes that you can find in our usuall targets.
 Most of the tutorials are directed towards cracking crypto crackmes as they provide the best
 and secure way to learn cryptography.
 You'll also find here tools to help you in your quest like factoring tools, libraries,
 and source codes related to, of course cryptography.
 As this is my site you'll also find my crackmes for you to test your skillz...
 This is what i have to tell you atm about this site...
 Enjoy your stay and be welcomed to come back :)

 * [http://www.racevb6.com/ RACEVB6]
 RACEVB6(©) is a Visual Basic 6 P-Code analyzer.
 RACEVB6(©) can be used to investigate Visual Basic 6 programs compiled to P-Code.
 RACEVB6(©) will display not only such typical information as Project data and Form/Control GUI data,
 but will also make available Procedures names and offsets, their accompanying P-Code opcodes,
 extract any Pictures or Images contined within the program, and many other pieces of "buried" data.

* [http://www.eresi-project.org/ The ERESI Reverse Engineering Software Interface]
 The ERESI Reverse Engineering Software Interface is a unified multi-architecture binary analysis framework
 targeting operating systems based on the Executable & Linking Format (ELF) such as Linux, *BSD, Solaris, Cisco IOS, IRIX and BeOS.

 !OllyCallTrace is a plugin for !OllyDbg (version 1.10) to trace the call chain of a thread
 allowing you to monitor it for irregularities to aid in the debugging of stack based buffer overflows
 as well as to quickly plot the execution flow of a program you are reversing.ds cracking crypto crackmes as they provide the best
