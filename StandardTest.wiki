#summary a user-mode opcodes tester

= Introduction =

this program tests most usermode opcodes, from obsolete to very recent, including undocumented ones, undefined use or encodings. As well, opcodes used as anti-debugs, exception triggers, Get IPs... (it helped me to find bugs in all the disassemblers that I tested, that is: !OllyDbg, !WinDbg, IDA, XED, !BeaEngine, libdasm, HT, Hiew, diStorm, Metasm, and other private projects...)

it uses several tricks to be able to test further than normally expected:
  * using segment 33h trick to test 64b opcodes
  * using !ZwAllocateVirtualMemory trick to allocate `[`0000-ffff`]`, so word jumps and returns are working

General FPU/SSE+ opcodes are not included: It's not intended to be complete, but just stress your emulator/knowledge a bit, and insist on specific points that are interesting.

The whole binary, including the PE structure, is hand-made in assembly, so your favorite security program might trigger a false positive warning.

= Details =

jumps opcodes:
  * call to word
  * jump short, near, to word, to reg32, to reg16, far
  * return near, near word, far, interrupt

classic opcodes:
  * mov movzx movsx lea xchg add sub sbb adc inc dec or and xor
  * not neg rol ror rcl rcr shl shr shld shrd div mul imul enter leave
  * setXX cmovXX bsf bsr bt btr btc bswap cbw cwde cwd

rare opcodes:
  * xadd aaa daa aas das aad aam lds bound arpl inc jcxz xlatb (on ebx and bx) lar
  * verr cmpxchg cmpxchg8b sldt lsl

undocumented opcodes:
  * aam xx, salc, aad xx, bswap reg16, smsw reg32

cpu specific opcodes:
  * popcnt movbe crc32

undocumented encodings:
  * test, 'sal'

os-dependant results:
  * smsw, sidt, sgdt, str, sysenter

nops-equivalent:
  * nop, pause, sfence, mfence, lfence, prefetch`*`, 'hint nop', into, fpu, lock + operators

anti-debuggers:
  * gs, smsw, rdtsc, pushf, pop ss

Get EIP:
  * call, call far, fstenv

Exception triggers:
  * generic int 00-FF , int 2d, illegal instruction,
  * into, int4, int3, int 3, IceBP, TF, bound, lock, in, hlt

documented but frequent disassembly mistakes:
  * bswap, smsw, str, branch hints, word calls/rets/loops, FS:movsd, xlatb, ud*

64 bits opcodes:
  * cwde, cmpxchg16, lea RIP, movsxd

= Use = 
It has currently no options. Just run it from command line, all tests will run after each other.

this is the output you could get under Windows 7, 64bit

Intermediate messages are displayed then removed, so if it crashes in the middle of the execution, you'll see instantly where.


= Building = 
assemble directly with yasm, no linker needed:
{{{
Yasm -o usermode_test.exe usermode_test.asm
}}}

=History=
 * 2011/04/01 - version 0.1

 * (in development) 
  * more prefetchnta/multi-byte nop encoding
  * 64bit: CQO, lock add (15 bytes)
  * specifics: RDTSCP
  * encodings: SLDT, FS:XLATB
  * for reference: PCMPISTRM, 16b LOCK ADD
