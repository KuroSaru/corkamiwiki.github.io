#summary a general presentation about binary packers

= Introduction =

A packer is a generic word for a lot of different kind of tools, including: _compressor, encryptor, protector, obfuscater, patcher...

Their common point is that they all create a binary from a source binary, and the result should execute like the source binary.

they might compress the original data (compressor), encrypt it (encryptor), add some counter-measure (anti-* (debuggers/tools/VM...), obfuscate code with polymorphism or junk

= Usual behavior =
most packers follow this 4-parts schema
# the start: commercial packers want to be identified, so even the most advanced always start in some recognizable way. Some even include the packer name as a string.
# the trapped entrance: the part with the most obfuscation, high polymorphism, counter-measures... usually decrypts next part
# the data manipulation part: this part restore the original data: uncompress, decrypt... usually with low or no protection at all.
# the system part: this part has to reproduce some system mechanisms (imports loading, relocation...) to make the original binary run correctly.
