#summary About the Corkami project
Corkami is the project that I started, to share my findings and experiments.

Here are the guidelines I'm *trying* to follow (I only work on it in my spare time, at home, on a netbook):
 * pure technical content, with as much detail as possible
 * free to browse (no annoying layout, no ads, ...)
 * free to download (no login required)
 * free to test (pre-compiled proof of concepts included)
 * free to modify (BSD Licence, complete sources included, even for pictures and documents, using open-source tools)
 * constantly updated (wiki format)
 * easy to bring with you (printable cheats sheets and graphs)

That's why it ended up here, after many different tries, as a project on google code.

Hope you like it,

Ange
