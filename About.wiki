#summary About the Corkami project
#labels Featured
Corkami is the name of the project that I started, to share my findings and experiments. (_Corkami_ doesn't mean anything btw, except maybe 'daughters' in polish, but that's a coincidence)

Here are the guidelines I'm *trying* to follow (I only work on it in my spare time, at home, on a netbook):
 * pure technical content, with as much detail as possible
 * free to browse (no annoying layout, no ads, ...)
 * free to download (no login required)
 * free to test (pre-compiled proof of concepts included)
 * free to modify (BSD Licence, complete sources included, even for pictures and documents, using open-source tools)
 * constantly updated (wiki format)
 * easy to bring with you (printable cheats sheets and graphs)

That's why it ended up here, after many different tries, as a project on google code. It's not perfect (the wiki is _sub-optimal_ for now), but better than anything else (blog, knoll, site,...) I tried so far).

Hope you like it,

Ange

== step 1 (2011/10/14) ==
 * the basics are now covered: [x86oddities x86] and [PE].
 * the style of publication reached a suitable form:
  * wiki pages with proof of concepts, and quoted snippets of code ([PE], [x86oddities x86] [PDFTricks PDF])
  * pdf made from svg ([http://code.google.com/p/corkami/downloads/list?q=pdf cheat sheets])
  * screencasts, with Wink ([http://rejava.sourceforge.net/hello.html reJava] [https://sites.google.com/site/corkami/ollydbg-tracing OllyDbg tracing])

so Corkami can step up and move on to the next level, following the same methods but tackling more advanced topics such as malware/packer analysis.
