 # Exceptions happen when something 'wrong' happens during code execution.

 # the system will handle it if no other code handled it before (it's a chain of handlers)
 # the handler is running on the same thread, but can read the context (values of all registers, including debug registers) of the thread when it happened.
 

you can set a Vectored Exception Handler (one per thread) or a Structured Exception Handler (typically, per function).

VEH are set via APIs, but SEH are set directly via a few instructions.

FS is an obvious reference, but can be hidden...
 * via `fs:[0]`
 * via `fs:[18h]`
 * hardcoded value
  * read it via !GetThreadSelectorEntry
 * pass to gs, ds...

Handlers get access to the context => easy and powerful way to modify your own thread without any API call
 * read/set registers values
 * read/set hardware breakpoint
  * detect debuggers
  * set them manually to reuse (ensure they're not used by a debugger)
 * read/set flag
  * read flags to 'emulate' conditional jump behavior (exception-controlled flow)
  * set trap flag manually to trigger an instruction after the next one is emulated

 * skip ntdll
  * overwrite return address in stack, to return directly to expected URL
 * overwrite handler address in stack, trigger another exception
